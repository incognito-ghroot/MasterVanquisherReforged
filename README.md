# Master Vanquisher Reforged

Master Vanquisher Reforged is a modernized version of the original GWA2 **MASTER VANQUISHER** project, updated and expanded for **GWAu3**. The project is designed to automate Guild Wars vanquishing across all campaigns while maintaining compatibility with modern systems.

Originally based on the work of the GWA2 community, many maps and systems have been updated and rewritten by **Mr. Obvious (incognito-ghroot)**.
